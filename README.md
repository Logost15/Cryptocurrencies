# Cryptocurrencies

Summary 
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The initial data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for the report, there is a need for unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies a clustering algorithm will be ideal to vizualize the data share findings with the board.

This way is really easy to understand, and buy crypto in a more eddicent way.
